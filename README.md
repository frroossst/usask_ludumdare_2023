# Farm Tower Defense

## Introduction

Welcome to "Farm Tower Defense", a unique twist on the classic tower defense genre set on a beautiful farm.
In this game, you will be responsible for planting and harvesting crops to earn money and defend your farm
against waves of enemies. Use your hard-earned cash to purchase a variety of towers with different abilities
to help you take down the enemy hoarde. Do you have what it takes to protect your farm and emerge victorious? 
Find out Farm Tower Defense!

## Mechanics

To get started, use the A and D keys to move around the farm. Left click to select and place towers, 
as well as to buy crops. Right click to destroy towers and deselect them.
Keep in mind that enemies have 100 HP and it's important to always be harvesting to earn money and buy 
more towers.

Good luck and happy defending!

## Developers

Connor Tamme and Adhyan Patel.

## Tools Used!

First time using Unity and C#, made with love and stress!

- Unity
- git (doesn't play nice with YAML files, found out the hard way!)
- VSCode

## The original plan

Make a hybrid of undercooked and classic tower defense, in a futuristic apocalypse, you play as a zombie and the
owner of a zombie farm where you can grown human organs (gross!) and harvest them (eww!) and you have humans
attacking your farm, defend your farm against humans using towers to hold them back, and on the other side of
the map you have hungry zombie customers ordering any and everything from "intestines on a stick" to "blood soup"

So, keep the humans at bay and your customers fed, or they might make a run for the fresh produce on your farm! (Double whamy?)

tldr; earn money undercooked style, spend it in tower defense style

We hoped the cute graphics would've made the rather violent lore more digestible for the player (think Splatoon!)
but, the game had to be stripped to a MVP due to it being the first game we were building haha!
